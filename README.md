# Red-Black-Trees
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a Red-Black Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, in C++. The project demonstrates the intricate balancing operations that maintain the tree's properties after insertions and deletions, ensuring logarithmic time complexity in the worst case for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

# Features
Node Structure: Each node in the tree contains data, color, and pointers to its parent and children

Insertion: Nodes are inserted following binary search tree properties with additional steps to fix any violations of Red-Black Tree properties.

Deletion: Nodes are removed with careful consideration to maintain the tree's balance. The implementation handles various cases like leaf node deletion, deletion of nodes with one or two children, and special cases involving 'double black' nodes.

Tree Rotations: The code includes left and right tree rotations to maintain balance during insertions and deletions.

Color Adjustments: Post-insertion and deletion, the tree undergoes color adjustments to maintain Red-Black properties.

Traversal and Printing: In-order traversal is implemented for tree visualization and debugging.

# Technical Details
The Red-Black Tree properties (each node is either red or black, the root is always black, all leaves are black, red nodes do not have red children, and every path from a node to its descendant leaves has the same number of black nodes) are rigorously maintained throughout all operations.
The implementation showcases the handling of complex tree restructuring, especially during deletion operations that involve double black nodes.

# Usage
This Red-Black Tree implementation can be utilized as a learning tool for understanding complex data structures and algorithms, especially those involving self-balancing binary search trees. It can also be integrated into projects that require efficient data storage and retrieval systems.
