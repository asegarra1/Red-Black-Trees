# Red-Black-Trees
This repository contains the implementation of a Red-Black Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, in C++. The project demonstrates the intricate balancing operations that maintain the tree's properties after insertions and deletions, ensuring logarithmic time complexity in the worst case for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
